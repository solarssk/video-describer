We came back from a motorcycle trip with 1 TB of GoPro footage and zero idea what was on most of it. My editor friend needed to start cutting, but scrubbing through raw files to find the good moments — the ones worth keeping — was going to take days.

**video-describer** points Claude at a folder of recordings and comes back with timestamped descriptions of what's happening in each file. Who's there, what they're doing, where they are, what the light looks like. Enough for an editor to know which clips are worth opening before they open them.

It works on GoPro, Insta360, and anything ffmpeg can read. Whisper transcription is optional — useful when there's actual dialogue you'd want to find later.

---

## What the output looks like

```
VID_20250829_173904 — departure day, Filip and Jadzia pack the motorcycle outside the building
00:15  Filip buckles the roll bags, checks the straps twice
02:30  Jadzia looks at the map on her phone, points at something
08:12  they pull out onto the street, morning light, long shadows
```

One `.txt` per file, next to the original. Your editor can grep it, read it, feed it into their own workflow — it's just text.

---

## Requirements

- macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel), Python 3.9+
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) — `brew install ffmpeg`
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/api-keys)

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solarssk/video-describer.git
cd video-describer
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 web_app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5555`. Go to **Connectors**, paste your API key. Point it at a folder. That's it.

The key is stored locally in `config.json` — it never leaves your machine.

---

## Speech transcription (optional)

If the footage has dialogue worth capturing, install a Whisper backend:

```bash
# Apple Silicon — runs on the Neural Engine, fast
pip3 install mlx-whisper

# Intel Mac — CPU only
pip3 install faster-whisper
```

You can run it alongside image analysis or as a standalone transcript. If neither is installed, image analysis still works fine.

---

## CLI

If you prefer terminal over browser:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-...'

python3 describe_videos.py /Volumes/GoPro/DCIM/

# with transcription
python3 describe_videos.py . --transcribe --whisper-model medium

# with context
python3 describe_videos.py . \
  --people "Filip, Jadzia" \
  --context "motorcycle trip, Poland to Serbia"
```

---

## How it works

1. ffmpeg extracts one frame every N seconds (default: 5s, configurable)
2. Frames are sent to Claude with a system prompt that tells it who the people are and what the trip is about
3. Claude returns a timestamped description
4. The description is saved as a `.txt` next to the original file

For Insta360 `.insv` files, it detects both lenses and analyzes them separately.

---

## Features

- **GoPro `.mp4`** — single stream
- **Insta360 `.insv`** — dual-lens, both cameras analyzed
- **Photos** — `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`
- **Auto-resume** — skips files that already have a `.txt`
- **Pre-flight check** — verifies the API key before doing any heavy work
- **Cost tracking** — live token count and USD cost in the header
- **Thermal protection** — if the Mac overheats during a long batch, Whisper automatically steps down to a lighter model
- **Settings tab** — model, pricing, frame interval, system prompt — editable in the UI without touching files
- **PL / EN UI** — interface language toggle, independent from output language (which is controlled by the system prompt)

---

## Cost

With `claude-sonnet-4-6` at default settings (up to 100 frames per video, 640 px wide):

> roughly **$0.15–0.25 per 30-minute recording**

Live token count and running cost are shown in the header while processing.

---

## Configuration

Everything is in the **Settings tab**. For direct edits, see `config.json` (created from `config.default.json` on first launch):

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ai.anthropic.model` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Claude model |
| `frames.video_width_px` | `640` | Smaller = cheaper, lower detail |
| `frames.max_per_video` | `100` | Cap per file |
| `defaults.people` | — | Pre-filled people list |
| `defaults.context` | — | Pre-filled trip context |
| `whisper.default_model` | `medium` | Starting Whisper model |

The system prompt lives in `prompts/system.md`. Change it to change the output language, tone, or format. PL and EN presets are available in Settings.

## Adding a provider

Implement `AIProvider` from `providers/base.py` — two methods: `verify()` and `describe()`. Register it in `providers/__init__.py` and add a config block under `ai.<name>` in `config.default.json`.

---

## Origin

This started after a motorcycle trip from Poland through Slovakia, Hungary and Serbia — Desert Horizons. We came back with about 1 TB of raw footage across two cameras. A friend who edits professionally was going to cut something from it, but the first step — just knowing what's on each clip — was going to take longer than the editing itself.

Editors are already using AI in their workflows. This is the part before that: giving them a map of the material before they open a single file.
