## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Batch resume** — state saved to `batch_state.json` after each file; on restart the app shows a banner ("Resume? 7/15 files, $0.43 spent") and picks up from where it left off. Resume is filename-verified, not just index-based, so adding or removing files between crash and resume is handled safely.
- **Budget guard** — optional USD limit in the Start form; pre-batch check blocks the run if the estimate exceeds the limit, mid-batch check stops gracefully before each new file.
- **Folder summary** — `_summary.txt` written to the input folder after each batch: one line per file (filename + first-line description), plus totals (files, cost, model). Skipped and pre-resume files are included so the summary is always complete.
- **File selection checkboxes** — deselect individual files from the list before starting; backend `/start` accepts an optional `files` filter.
- **Frame interval warning** — when the interval is auto-adjusted to fit the `max_frames` cap, a yellow `⚠` log line says exactly what changed and why, instead of silently changing settings.
- **Rotating log file** (`app.log`) — every print-to-UI line is also written to `app.log` (2 MB × 3 backups, gitignored). Each startup writes a banner with timestamp and port. Useful for post-mortem debugging: `grep ERROR app.log`.

### Fixed

- **Whisper SIGABRT crash** (exit code −6) — `multiprocessing` context changed from `fork` to `spawn`. `fork` + Flask threads + ObjC runtime caused `+[NSCheapMutableString initialize]` to race across the fork boundary, crashing every Whisper job silently. `spawn` gives the child a clean interpreter.
- **Whisper crash messages** — instead of `"Whisper process exited with code -6"`, the UI now shows `"Whisper crashed (SIGABRT (ObjC/Metal crash)) — transcription skipped for this file"`. Batch continues with frame-only description.
- **Resume: errored files retried** — state was saved with `next_index = abs_index` after an error, so resume would skip the failed file. Now saves `abs_index − 1` so the file is retried.
- **Resume: complete summary** — `_summary.txt` now includes files processed before the interruption (reconstructed from existing `.txt` outputs), not just the tail processed after resume.
- **Resume: skipped files in summary** — files with existing `.txt` that are skipped on re-run now contribute their first line to the summary, so a re-run over a completed batch regenerates the full `_summary.txt` at zero API cost.
- **Budget: resume offset in preflight** — pre-batch estimate check now adds `resume_cost_offset` to `est_cost` before comparing against the limit, so a resumed batch with $0.80 already spent correctly fails a $1.00 budget check.
- **Budget message** — mid-batch "budget reached" message now shows absolute file count (`10/100`) instead of the remaining slice count (`10/40`) when resuming.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- **Web UI** — Flask-based interface at `localhost:5555`; replaces running the CLI directly for most workflows
- **Connectors tab** — API keys stored in `config.json` (gitignored), no longer passed as env vars or CLI flags
- **Insta360 `.insv` support** — dual-lens detection, both cameras analyzed separately
- **Speech transcription** — optional Whisper integration; mlx-whisper on Apple Silicon, faster-whisper on Intel
- **Whisper auto-fallback** — steps down to a lighter model automatically when the system overheats during a long batch
- **Cost tracking** — live token count and USD cost shown in the header during processing
- **Pre-flight check** — verifies the API key and ffmpeg before doing any heavy work
- **Settings tab** — model, pricing, frame interval, system prompt editable in the UI
- **PL / EN UI toggle** — interface language independent from output language
- **OpenAI provider** — optional fallback; Whisper via OpenAI API when no local backend is installed
- **Provider architecture** — `providers/` module makes it straightforward to add new AI backends

### Changed

- Config structure migrated from flat `claude.*` keys to `ai.anthropic.*` (legacy configs auto-migrate on first load)
- Frame extraction defaults tuned: 640 px wide, up to 100 frames per video
